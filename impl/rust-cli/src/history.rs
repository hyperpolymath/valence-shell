//! Placeholder for future history analysis and export functionality.
//! TODO: Implement history export, statistics, and undo path computation
//! when needed for MAA audit logging (Phase 5).
//!
//! Planned features:
//! - JSON export of operation history
//! - Statistics about command usage (operation counts, success rates)
//! - Undo path visualization for transaction analysis
//! - Audit trail generation for MAA framework
//! - Historical query interface (find ops by path, type, time range)
//!
//! These features will be added when the BEAM daemon is integrated
//! for distributed audit logging.
