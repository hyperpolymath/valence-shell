= Governance Model

:toclevels: 2

== Overview

Valence Shell follows a **Tri-Perimeter Governance Model** aligned with the TPCF (Tri-Perimeter Contribution Framework).

== Decision-Making Structure

=== Perimeter 1: Core (Benevolent Dictatorship)

**Scope**: Formal proofs, security-critical code, foundational architecture

**Decision Makers**: Project maintainers with formal verification expertise

**Process**:
. Proposal via RFC (Request for Comments)
. Technical review by all core maintainers
. Proof verification
. Consensus required (all maintainers must approve)
. Implementation with tests
. Final review before merge

**Timeline**: 2-4 weeks minimum for major changes

=== Perimeter 2: Extensions (Maintainer Review)

**Scope**: Implementations, features, optimizations

**Decision Makers**: Project maintainers + trusted contributors

**Process**:
. Feature proposal via GitHub/GitLab issue
. Design discussion
. Implementation by contributor
. Code review by at least 1 maintainer
. CI/CD must pass
. Merge with maintainer approval

**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks for typical features

=== Perimeter 3: Community (Open Contribution)

**Scope**: Examples, tutorials, documentation, tools

**Decision Makers**: Any maintainer can approve

**Process**:
. Submit pull/merge request
. Self-document the contribution
. Basic tests pass
. Quick review by any maintainer
. Merge

**Timeline**: 1-3 days

== Roles and Responsibilities

=== Core Maintainers

**Responsibilities**:

* Maintain formal proofs
* Review security-critical changes
* Set technical direction
* Manage releases
* Enforce Code of Conduct
* Respond to security issues

**Requirements**:

* Formal verification expertise (Coq/Lean/Agda/Isabelle)
* 2+ years in formal methods
* Commitment to project values
* Active participation

**Current**: See MAINTAINERS.md

=== Trusted Contributors

**Responsibilities**:

* Implement features per specifications
* Review community contributions
* Help newcomers
* Maintain test coverage
* Update documentation

**Path to Becoming**:

. 5+ quality contributions to Perimeter 3
. Demonstrate understanding of formal specifications
. Follow coding standards
. Help community members
. Nomination by core maintainer
. Majority vote of existing maintainers

=== Community Contributors

**Responsibilities**:

* Follow Code of Conduct
* Test contributions
* Document work
* Help others when possible

**How to Start**:

. Read CONTRIBUTING.md
. Find `good-first-issue` tag
. Submit PR to Perimeter 3
. Iterate based on feedback

== Conflict Resolution

=== Technical Disagreements

. Discussion in GitHub/GitLab issue
. Present evidence (benchmarks, formal proofs, citations)
. Seek consensus
. If no consensus: Core maintainers vote
. Benevolent dictator (project lead) breaks ties
. Document decision rationale

=== Interpersonal Conflicts

. Follow CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
. Private discussion first
. Escalate to maintainers if needed
. Formal Code of Conduct process
. Appeals process available

== Succession Planning

=== Adding Core Maintainers

**Process**:

. Nomination by existing core maintainer
. Must have:
   - Formal verification expertise
   - 1+ year as trusted contributor
   - Significant proof contributions
   - Community respect
. Discussion period (2 weeks)
. **Consensus vote** (all core maintainers must approve)
. Public announcement

=== Removing Core Maintainers

**Scenarios**:

* Voluntary: Maintainer steps down (honored in MAINTAINERS.md as emeritus)
* Inactivity: No activity for 6+ months (gentle inquiry first)
* Code of Conduct violation: Per enforcement process

**Process**: Consensus of remaining core maintainers

=== Project Continuity

. All knowledge documented (not in heads)
. Proofs are self-documenting
. Regular succession planning discussions
. Bus factor mitigation (train multiple maintainers)
. Emergency contact: See SECURITY.md

== Financial Governance

**Current Status**: Unfunded research project

**If Funded**:

. Transparent budgeting
. Quarterly financial reports
. OpenCollective or similar (public ledger)
. Spending decisions: Core maintainers consensus
. No profit motive (solidarity economics)

== Release Management

=== Versioning

. **Semantic Versioning 2.0**
. Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., 0.5.0)
. Pre-1.0: Research prototype
. 1.0+: Production-ready (after extraction gap closed)

=== Release Process

. Version bump in CHANGELOG.md
. Tag commit: `git tag -a v0.x.x`
. CI/CD runs full verification
. All proofs must compile
. All tests must pass
. Security audit (for major versions)
. Announce on GitHub/GitLab
. Update documentation

=== Release Cadence

* **Minor releases**: Every 2-3 months (when features ready)
* **Patch releases**: As needed for critical fixes
* **Major releases**: When architecture changes

== Intellectual Property

=== Copyright

. Contributors retain copyright
. License: MIT OR GPL, Palimpsest recommended (see LICENSE.txt)
. No copyright assignment required
. Attribution preserved (Palimpsest requirement)

=== Patents

. No patent trolling
. If contributor holds patents on contributed code, grant royalty-free license
. Defensive patent use only

== Code of Conduct Enforcement

See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for full details.

**Enforcement Team**:

* Core maintainers
* Can designate CoC officers

**Process**:

. Report received (confidential)
. Investigation (1-2 weeks)
. Decision: Correction, Warning, Temporary Ban, Permanent Ban
. Appeals process available

== Amendment Process

**Changing This Governance Document**:

. Proposal via GitHub/GitLab issue
. Discussion period (4 weeks minimum)
. Consensus of core maintainers
. Update GOVERNANCE.adoc
. Announce changes publicly

== Transparency

=== Public

* Decisions and rationale
* Release plans and roadmap
* Security advisories
* Code of Conduct enforcement statistics (anonymized)
* Financial information (if funded)

=== Private

* Security vulnerabilities (until fixed)
* Code of Conduct reports (unless reporter requests public)
* Personnel matters
* Pre-decision discussions (working drafts)

== Communication Channels

* **Public discussion**: GitHub/GitLab issues
* **Security issues**: See SECURITY.md
* **Code of Conduct**: See CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
* **General email**: See MAINTAINERS.md

== Values and Principles

. **Formal correctness** over speed
. **Mathematical guarantees** over testing alone
. **Transparency** over secrecy
. **Community** over ego
. **Documentation** over oral tradition
. **Reproducibility** over "works on my machine"
. **Emotional safety** alongside technical rigor

== Acknowledgment

This governance model is inspired by:

* Rust Project governance
* Python PEPs (Enhancement Proposals)
* Apache Software Foundation
* Contributor Covenant
